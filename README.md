# JavaScript Loose Equality and Null Checks

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to loose equality (`==`) and null checks.  The `bug.js` file contains code that uses loose equality to check for null values, leading to unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected code using strict equality (`===`).

## Problem

JavaScript's loose equality operator (`==`) performs type coercion before comparison, which can cause unexpected results when checking for null or undefined. In the example below, using loose equality with null in a conditional statement does not reliably short-circuit the evaluation.

## Solution

The correct approach is to use the strict equality operator (`===`), which does not perform type coercion. This ensures accurate null checks and prevents the unexpected behavior caused by loose equality.
